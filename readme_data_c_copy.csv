abhisheknaiidu/uPlot,True,"📈  μPlot A small ( ~35 KB min ),  fast  chart for time series, lines, areas, ohlc &amp; bars  (MIT Licensed) Introduction μPlot is a  fast, memory-efficient Canvas 2D -based chart for plotting  time series , lines, areas, ohlc &amp; bars; from a cold start it can create an interactive chart containing 150,000 data points in 135ms, scaling linearly at  ~25,000 pts/ms . In addition to fast initial render, the zooming and cursor performance is by far the best of any similar charting lib; at ~35 KB, it's likely the smallest and fastest time series plotter that doesn't make use of  context-limited  WebGL shaders or WASM, both of which have much higher startup cost and code size. 166,650 point bench:  https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/bench/uPlot.html However, if you need 60fps performance with massive streaming datasets, uPlot  can only get you so far danchitnis/webgl-plot ,  huww98/TimeChart ,  epezent/implot , or commercial products like  LightningChart® . Features Multiple series w/toggle Multiple y-axes, scales &amp; grids Temporal or numeric x-axis Linear, uniform or  logarithmic  scales Line &amp; Area styles (stroke, fill, width, dash) Pluggable path renderers  linear, spline, stepped, bars Zoom with auto-rescale Legend with live values Support for  IANA Time Zone Names  &amp; DST Support for missing data Cursor sync for multiple charts Focus closest series Data streaming (live update) High / Low bands A lean, consistent, and powerful API with hooks &amp; plugins Non-Features In order to stay lean, fast and focused the following features will not be added: No data parsing, aggregation, summation or statistical processing - just do it in advance. e.g.  https://simplestatistics.org/ ,  https://www.papaparse.com/ No transitions or animations - they're always pure distractions. No collision avoidance for axis tick labels, so may require manual tweaking of spacing metrics if label customization significiantly increases default label widths. No stacked series: see  ""Stacked Area Graphs Are Not Your Friend""  and a  horrific demo . While smooth spline interpolation is available, its use is strongly discouraged:  Your data is misrepresented! . Both visualizations are terrible at accurately communicating information. No built-in drag scrolling/panning due to ambiguous native zoom/selection behavior. However, this can be added externally via the plugin/hooks API:  zoom-wheel ,  zoom-touch . Documentation (WIP) /docs/README.md /dist/uPlot.d.ts /demos  covers the vast majority of uPlot's API.

murat-aka/laravel5,True,"Laravel PHP Framework Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching. Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

murat-aka/opencv-processing,True,"OpenCV for Processing A Processing library for the  OpenCV  computer vision library. OpenCV for Processing is based on OpenCV's official Java bindings. It attempts to provide convenient wrappers for common OpenCV functions that are friendly to beginners and feel familiar to the Processing environment. See the included examples below for an overview of what's possible and links to the relevant example code. Complete documentation is available here: OpenCV for Processing reference OpenCV for Processing is based on the officially supported  OpenCV Java API , currently at version 2.4.5. In addition to using the wrapped functionality, you can import OpenCV modules and use any of its documented functions:  OpenCV javadocs . See the advanced examples (HistogramSkinDetection, DepthFromStereo, and Marker Detection) below for details. (This style of API was inspired by Kyle McDonald's  ofxCv addon  for OpenFrameworks.) Contributions welcome. Installing OpenCV for Processing currently supports Mac OSX, 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, 32- and 64-bit Linux. Android support is hopefully coming soon (pull requests welcome). NB: When running on the Mac, make sure you have Processing set to 64-bit mode in the Preferences See  here  for the latest release.

murat-aka/ruby1,True,"README Ruby on Rails Tutorial (Rails 5) Learn Web Development with Rails Michael Hartl www.railstutorial.org wiki Page Chapter 2 A toy app In this chapter, we’ll develop a toy demo application to show off some of the power of Rails. The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators, which create a large amount of functionality automatically. As discussed in Box 1.2, the rest of the book will take the opposite approach, developing a full sample application incrementally and explaining each new concept as it arises, but for a quick overview (and some instant gratification) there is no substitute for scaffolding. The resulting toy app will allow us to interact with it through its URLs, giving us insight into the structure of a Rails application, including a first example of the REST architecture favored by Rails. As with the forthcoming sample application, the toy app will consist of users and their associated microposts (thus constituting a minimalist Twitter-style app). The functionality will be utterly under-developed, and many of the steps will seem like magic, but worry not: the full sample app will develop a similar application from the ground up starting in Chapter 3, and I will provide plentiful forward-references to later material. In the mean time, have patience and a little faith—the whole point of this tutorial is to take you beyond this superficial, scaffold-driven approach to achieve a deeper understanding of Rails.","[{'programming_language': 'Ruby', 'percentage': 71.9}, {'programming_language': 'HTML', 'percentage': 20.0}, {'programming_language': 'CSS', 'percentage': 4.7}, {'programming_language': 'JavaScript', 'percentage': 2.5}, {'programming_language': 'CoffeeScript', 'percentage': 0.9}]"

hummus/git-fat,True,"Introduction Features of  git-fat clones of the source repository are small and fast because no binaries are transferred, yet fully functional with complete metadata and incremental retrieval ( git clone --depth  has limited granularity and couples metadata to content) git-fat  supports the same workflow for large binaries and traditionally versioned files, but internally manages the ""fat"" files separately git-bisect  works properly even when versions of the binary files change over time selective control of which large files to pull into the local store local fat object stores can be shared between multiple clones, even by different users can easily support fat object stores distributed across multiple hosts depends only on stock Python and rsync Related projects git-annex  is a far more comprehensive solution, but with less transparent workflow and with more dependencies. git-media  adopts a similar approach to  git-fat , but with a different synchronization philosophy and with many Ruby dependencies. Installation and configuration Place  git-fat  in your  PATH . Edit (or create)  .gitattributes  to regard any desired extensions as fat files. Run  git fat init Set a remote store for the fat objects by editing  .gitfat . sshuser  and  sshport  variables in  .gitfat fat A worked example git-fat  will not be shown. First, we create a repository and configure it for use with  git-fat . Now we add a binary file whose name matches the pattern we set in  .gitattributes . The patch itself is very simple and does not include the binary. Pushing fat files Now let's push our fat files using the rsync configuration that we set up earlier. We might normally set a remote now and push the git repository. Cloning and pulling Now let's look at what happens when we clone. We can always get a summary of what fat objects are missing in our local cache.

hummus/python-whois,True,"pythonwhois A WHOIS retrieval and parsing library for Python. Dependencies None! All you need is the Python standard library. Instructions The manual (including install instructions) can be found in the doc/ directory. A HTML version is also viewable  here . Goals 100% coverage of WHOIS formats. Accurate and complete data. Consistently functional parsing; constant tests to ensure the parser isn't accidentally broken. Features Able to follow WHOIS server redirects Won't get stuck on multiple-result responses from verisign-grs Base information (registrar, etc.) Dates/times (registration, expiry, ...) Full registrant information (!) Nameservers Attempts to intelligently reformat WHOIS data for better (human) readability Airport codes Country names (2- and 3-letter ISO codes) US states and territories Canadian states and territories Australian states pwhois Easily readable output format Can also output raw WHOIS data ... and JSON. Will detect and warn about any changes in parsed data compared to previous runs Guarantees that previously working WHOIS parsing doesn't unintentionally break when changing code IP range WHOIS pythonwhois  does not yet support WHOIS lookups on IP ranges (including single IPs), although this will be added at some point in the future. In the meantime, consider using  ipwhois  - it offers functionality and an API similar to  pythonwhois , but for IPs. It also supports delegated RWhois. Do note that  ipwhois  does not offer a normalization feature, and does not (yet) come with a command-line tool. Additionally,  ipwhois  is maintained by Philip Hane and not by me; please make sure to file bugs relating to it in the  ipwhois  repository, not in that of  pythonwhois . Important update notes 2.4.0 and up : A lot of changes were made to the normalization, and the performance under Python 2.x was significantly improved. The average parsing time under Python 2.7 has dropped by 94% (!), and on my system averages out at 18ms. Performance under Python 3.x is  unchanged .  pythonwhois  will now expand a lot of abbreviations in normalized mode, such as airport codes, ISO country codes, and US/CA/AU state abbreviations. The consequence of this is that the library is now bigger (as it ships a list of these abbreviations). Also note that there  may  be licensing consequences, in particular regarding the airport code database. More information about that can be found below. 2.3.0 and up : Python 3 support was fixed. Creation date parsing for contacts was fixed; correct timestamps will now be returned, rather than unformatted ones - if your application relies on the broken variant, you'll need to change your code. Some additional parameters were added to the  net  and  parse  methods to facilitate NIC handle lookups; the defaults are backwards-compatible, and these changes should not have any consequences for your code. Thai WHOIS parsing was implemented, but is a little spotty - data may occasionally be incorrectly split up. Please submit a bug report if you run across any issues. 2.2.0 and up : The internal workings of  get_whois_raw  have been changed, to better facilitate parsing of WHOIS data from registries that may return multiple partial matches for a query, such as  whois.verisign-grs.com . This change means that, by default,  get_whois_raw  will now strip out the part of such a response that does not pertain directly to the requested domain. If your application requires an unmodified raw WHOIS response and is calling  get_whois_raw  directly, you should use the new  never_cut  parameter to keep pythonwhois from doing this post-processing. As this is a potentially breaking behaviour change, the minor version has been bumped. It doesn't work! It doesn't work at all? It doesn't parse the data for a particular domain? There's an inaccuracy in parsing the data for a domain, even just a small one? If any of those apply, don't hesitate to file an issue! The goal is 100% coverage, and we need your feedback to reach that goal. License This library may be used under the WTFPL - or, if you take issue with that, consider it to be under the CC0. Data sources This library uses a number of third-party datasets for normalization: airports.dat :  OpenFlights Airports Database  ( Open Database License 1.0 ,  Database Contents License 1.0 ) countries.dat :  Country List  (MIT license) countries3.dat :  ISO countries list  (license unspecified) states_au.dat : Part of  pythonwhois  (WTFPL/CC0) states_us.dat :  State Table  (license unspecified, free reuse encouraged) states_ca.dat :  State Table  (license unspecified, free reuse encouraged) Be aware that the OpenFlights database in particular has potential licensing consequences; if you do not wish to be bound by these potential consequences, you may simply delete the  airports.dat  file from your distribution.  pythonwhois  will assume there is no database available, and will not perform airport code conversion (but still function correctly otherwise). This also applies to other included datasets. Contributing Feel free to fork and submit pull requests (to the  develop  branch)! If you change any parsing or normalization logic, ensure to run the full test suite before opening a pull request. Instructions for that are below.

The DAO of Minimal Linux Live  - this tutorial explains step by step what you need to do in order to create your own minimalistic live Linux OS. The tutorial is based on the first published version of Minimal Linux Live. Component Architecture of Minimal Linux Live  - this publication describes the high level components included in the ""03-Apr-2016"" version of Minimal Linux Live. You can experiment with Minimal Linux Live directly in your browser by using  JavaScript PC Emulator . Here is a screenshot: Did I mention the  YouTube channel  where you can watch some of the cool Minimal Linux Live features? No? Well, now you know about it! :) This is a screenshot of the current development version of Minimal Linux Live: Current development state (29-Jan-2017) Linux kernel 4.4.44 (longterm) GNU C Library 2.24 (stable) BusyBox 1.26.2 (stable) Stable on default Ubuntu 16.04.1 installation (32-bit and 64-bit) with applied system updates. Future improvements Add kernel modules and firmware. Reorganize and simplify the ISO image generation script. Allow individual overlay bundles to be downloaded and installed. The above list is not fixed it may be updated at any time. How to build The section below is for Ubuntu and other Debian based distros. The default build process uses some custom provided  CFLAGS . They can be found in the  .config  file. Some of these additional flags were introduced in order to fix different issues which were reported during the development phase. However, there is no guarantee that the build process will run smoothly on your system with these particular flags. If you get compilation issues (please note that I'm talking about compilation issues, not about general shell script issues), you can try to disable these flags and then start the build process again. It may turn out that on your particular host system you don't need these flags. Overlay bundles Important note!  The overlay bundles come without support since the build process for almost all of them is host specific and can vary significantly between different machines. Therefore the bundle build process is disabled by default. The current development version introduces the concept of  overlay bundles . During the boot process the  OverlayFS  driver merges the initramfs with the content of these bundles. Currently this is the mechanism which allows you to build additional software on top of MLL without touching the core build process. In fact the overlay bundle system has been designed to be completely independent from the MLL build process. You can build one or more overlay bundles without building MLL at all. However, some of the overlay bundles have dependencies on the software pieces provided by the MLL build process, so it is recommended to use the overlay build subsystem as last step before you produce the final ISO image. BIOS and UEFI Minimal Linux Live is UEFI compatible and now the same MLL ISO image can boot on both BIOS and EFI based systems. Go on, try it! Installation The build process produces ISO image which you can use in virtual machine or you can burn it on real CD/DVD. Installing MLL on USB flash drive currently is not supported but it can be easily achieved by using  syslinux  or   extlinux  since MLL requires just two files (one kernel file and another initramfs file). Another way to install MLL on USB flash drive is by using  YUMI  or other similar tools. Yet another way to install MLL on USB flash drive is manually, like this: Projects based on Minimal Linux Live: Minimal Linux Script  - very simplified and minimalistic version of MLL. This project is recommended as a starting point for beginners. Boot2Minc  - this fork adds  Mincs  and as result you can run Linux containers inside MLL.

K1773R's MLL  - PowerPC version of Minimal Linux Live with  memtester  as additional software. Impressive work! Ladiko's MLL  - this fork automatically downloads and uses the latest available Kernel and BusyBox sources. By default there is NTFS and SquashFS support. The fork also provides an installer which can be used to put MLL on USB flash device. AwlsomeLinux  - MLL fork which provides additional overlay bundles (ncurses and Nano). StarLinux  - the successor of  AwlsomeLinux . StarLinux aims at making the build process user friendly. prologic's MLL  - this fork adds Python support to the MLL runtime environment. KernelISO  - extended version of MLL. diaob's MLL  - MLL translation to Simplified Chinese. bdheeman's MLL  - MLL KISS fork (Keep It, Simple, Safe/Secure/Stupid). Runlinux  - environment to build and test Linux kernels. Thank you! Do you like this project? Yes? Well, in that case I would very much appreciate it if you  buy me a beer  and perhaps spend a minute to give your honest opinion about MLL in  DistroWatch .

hummus/poetry-generator,True,"A Python2 based Backus-Naur poetry generator. This program works on the basis that every word in the English language is either ""positive"" or ""negative."" For instance ""lovely"" is positive and ""thorn"" is negative. A ""poem"" is a group of sentences that are structured in a way to have +1, -1 or 0 in terms of the positivity/negativity.  A ""mushy poem"" is strictly positive. All the syntax and word choices are in the  brain.yaml  file (more info about this below). Try the  demo here . Changes in new version Use YAML Reverted to Python2 (to use Nodebox Linguistics) Use Nodebox Linguistics for plurality and conjugations (saves much space) Poem dictation (Chrome only) Setup Follow these commands to generate a poem if you have minimal experience coding/etc. Open up a terminal and use cd  poetry-generator Install Python requirements pip install -r requirements.txt Download and unzip the NodeBox linguistics package: And then run using waitress-serve --port=8000 poetrygenerator:application Then open your browser to  localhost:8000  to see the poetry generator. About the brain file Examples of the types of words: Currently you only need to put in the infinitive form, and the other forms will be determined automaticlaly. Deployment I wrote a deployment script for easy NGINX deployment (keep reading). This will install NGINX blocks, as well as a Linux  init.d  script to automatically start and stop gunicorn. Edit deploy.py to change or leave the same - its up to you. Then run This program now uses  virtualenv  so it can be deployed with  gunicorn . The installation creates  virtualenv  and downloads the packages. Then it writes a new  init.d  script and sends that so that it can automatically start and stop. If you deploy, it will also generate a nginx server block so its already to go. The program should be running and accessible on your LAN network at Common Error When you run, you may see the following error: [....] Reloading nginx configuration (via systemctl): nginx.serviceJob  for  nginx.service failed. See  ' systemctl status nginx.service '  and  ' journalctl -xn ' for ! To fix this, you just need to enable the server_names in nginx. First And uncomment these lines: server_names_hash_bucket_size 64 ; ; and  now  you should be good to go!

hummus/moto,True,"Moto - Mock Boto In a nutshell Moto is a library that allows your python tests to easily mock out the boto library. Imagine you have the following code that you want to test: import boto from boto . s3 . key import Key class MyModel ( object def __init__ ( self ,  name ,  value self . name = name self . value = value def save ( self conn = boto . connect_s3 bucket = conn . get_bucket ( 'mybucket' k = Key ( bucket k . key = self . name k . set_contents_from_string ( self . value ) Take a minute to think how you would have tested that in the past. Now see how you could test it with Moto: import boto from moto import mock_s3 from mymodule import MyModel @ mock_s3 def test_my_model_save conn = boto . connect_s3 # We need to create the bucket since this is all in Moto's 'virtual' AWS account conn . create_bucket ( 'mybucket' model_instance = MyModel ( 'steve' ,  'is awesome' model_instance . save assert conn . get_bucket ( 'mybucket' ). get_key ( 'steve' ). get_contents_as_string ()  == 'is awesome' With the decorator wrapping the test, all the calls to s3 are automatically mocked out. The mock keeps the state of the buckets and keys. It gets even better! Moto isn't just S3. Here's the status of the other AWS services implemented. |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  Service Name           |  Decorator         |  Development Status                 | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  API Gateway            | @ mock_apigateway  |  core endpoints done                | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  Autoscaling            | @ mock_autoscaling |  core endpoints done                | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  Cloudformation         | @ mock_cloudformation |  core endpoints done             | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  Cloudwatch             | @ mock_cloudwatch  |  basic endpoints done               | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  Data Pipeline          | @ mock_datapipeline |  basic endpoints done              | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  DynamoDB               | @ mock_dynamodb    |  core endpoints done                | |  DynamoDB2              | @ mock_dynamodb2   |  core endpoints  +  partial indexes   | |------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |  EC2                    | @ mock_ec2         |  core endpoints done                | |     -

It only mocks AWS endpoints, so there should be no issue with boto3 or using other languages. Feel free to open an issue if something isn't working though. If you are using another language, you will need to either use the stand-alone server mode (more below) or monkey patch the HTTP calls yourself. Stand-alone Server Mode Moto also comes with a stand-alone server mode. This allows you to utilize the backend structure of Moto even if you don't use Python. To run a service: $  moto_server ec2  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ You can also pass the port as the second argument: $  moto_server ec2 -p3000  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:3000/ Then go to  localhost  to see a list of running instances (it will be empty since you haven't added any yet). If you want to use boto with this (using the simpler decorators above instead is strongly encouraged), the easiest way is to create a boto config file ( ~/.boto ) with the following values: Install $  pip install moto Thanks A huge thanks to  Gabriel Falcão  and his  HTTPretty  library.

Access Kibana's web interface by browsing to  http://&lt;your-host&gt;:5601 , where  &lt;your-host&gt;  is the hostname or IP address of the host Docker is running on (see note), e.g.  localhost  if running a local native version of Docker, or the IP address of the virtual machine if running a VM-hosted version of Docker (see note). Note  – To configure and/or find out the IP address of a VM-hosted Docker installation, see  https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/  (Windows) and  https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/  (Mac OS X) for guidance if using Boot2Docker. If you're using  Vagrant , you'll need to set up port forwarding (see  https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/forwarded_ports.html . Running the image using Docker Compose or Fig If you're using  Docker Compose  (formerly known as Fig) to manage your Docker services (and if not you really should as it will make your life much easier!), then you can create an entry for the ELK Docker image by adding the following lines to your  docker-compose.yml  file (or  fig.yml  if using Fig): You can then start the ELK container like this: or (with Fig): As from Kibana version 4.0.0, you won't be able to see anything (not even an empty dashboard) until something has been logged (see the next sub-section on how to test your set-up by creating a dummy log entry, and the next section on how to forward logs from regular applications). Creating a dummy log entry If you haven't got any logs yet and want to manually create a dummy log entry for test purposes (for instance to see the dashboard), first start the container as usual ( sudo docker run ...  or  docker-compose up ... ). In another terminal window, find out the name of the container running ELK, which is displayed in the last column of the output of the  sudo docker ps  command. Open a shell prompt in the container and type (replacing  &lt;container-name&gt;  with the name of the container, e.g.  elkdocker_elk_1  in the example above): Note  - If you're running a pre-1.4 version of Docker (before the  exec  command was introduced) then: Run the container interactively: With the regular  docker  command use  sudo docker run -p 5601:5601 -p 9200:9200 -p 5000:5000 -it --name elk sebp/elk /bin/bash  – note the extra  /bin/bash  at the end compared to the usual command line With Docker Compose or Fig use  sudo docker-compose run --service-ports elk /bin/bash  (substituting  fig  for  docker-compose  if you're using Fig). At the container's shell prompt, type to  start.sh&amp;  to start Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana in the background, and wait for everything to be up and running (wait for  {""@timestamp"":…,""message"":""Listening on 0.0.0.0:5601"",…} ) Now enter: And then type some dummy text followed by Enter to create a log entry: Note  - You can create as many entries as you want. Use  ^C  to go back to the bash prompt. After a few seconds if you browse to  http://:9200/_search?pretty  (e.g.  http://localhost:9200/_search?pretty  for a local native instance of Docker) you'll see that Elasticsearch has indexed the entry: You can now browse to Kibana's web interface at  http://:5601  (e.g.  http://localhost:5601  for a local native instance of Docker). From the drop-down ""Time-field name"" field, select  @timestamp , then click on ""Create"", and you're good to go. Forwarding logs Forwarding logs from a host relies on a Logstash forwarder agent collecting logs (e.g. from log files, from the syslog daemon) and sending them to our instance of Logstash. Install  Logstash forwarder  on the host you want to collect and forward logs from (see the References section below for links to detailed instructions). Here is a sample configuration file for Logstash forwarder, that forwards syslog and authentication logs, as well as  nginx  logs. By default (see  /etc/init.d/logstash-forwarder  if you need to tweak anything): The Logstash forwarder configuration file must be located in  /etc/logstash-forwarder . The Logstash forwarder needs a syslog daemon (e.g. rsyslogd, syslog-ng) to be running. In the sample configuration file, make sure that you: Replace  elk  in  elk:5000  with the hostname or IP address of the ELK-serving host. Copy the  logstash-forwarder.crt  file (which contains the Logstash server's certificate) from the ELK image to  /etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-forwarder.crt . Note  – The ELK image includes configuration items ( /etc/logstash/conf.d/11-nginx.conf  and  /opt/logstash/patterns/nginx ) to parse nginx access logs, as forwarded by the Logstash forwarder instance above. Linking a Docker container to the ELK container If you want to forward logs from a local Docker container to the ELK container, then you need to link the two containers. First of all, give the ELK container a name (e.g.  elk ) using the  --name  option: Then start the log-emitting container with the  --link  option: From the perspective of the log emitting container, the ELK container is now known as  elk , which is the hostname to be used in the  logstash-forwarder  configuration file. With Docker Compose (or Fig) here's what example entries for a (locally built log-generating) nginx container and an ELK container could look like in the  docker-compose.yml  (or  fig.yml ) file. Building the image To build the Docker image from the source files, first clone the  Git repository , go to the root of the cloned directory (i.e. the directory that contains  Dockerfile ), and: If you're using the vanilla  docker  command then run  sudo docker build . -t &lt;repository-name&gt; , where  &lt;repository-name&gt;  is the repository name to be applied to the image, which you can then use to run the image with the  docker run  command. If you're using Docker Compose then run  sudo docker-compose build elk , which uses the  docker-compose.yml  file to build the image. You can then run the built image with  sudo docker-compose up . If you're using Fig, then rename  docker-compose.yml  to  fig.yml  and run  sudo fig build elk . Start the resulting image with  sudo fig up . Extending the image To extend the image, you can either fork the source Git repository and hack away, or – more in the spirit of the Docker philosophy – use the image as a base image and build on it, adding files (e.g. configuration files to process logs sent by log-producing applications) and overwriting files (e.g. configuration files, certificate and private key files) as required. To create a new image based on this base image, you want your  Dockerfile  to include: followed by instructions to extend the image (see Docker's  Dockerfile Reference page  for more information). Security considerations As it stands this image is meant for local test use, and as such hasn't been secured: access to the ELK services is not restricted, and a default authentication server certificate ( logstash-forwarder.crt ) and private key ( logstash-forwarder.key ) are bundled with the image. To harden this image, at the very least you would want to: Restrict the access to the ELK services to authorised hosts/networks only, as described in e.g.  Elasticsearch Scripting and Security  and  Elastic Security: Deploying Logstash, ElasticSearch, Kibana ""securely"" on the Internet  . Password-protect the access to Kibana and Elasticsearch (see  SSL And Password Protection for Kibana . Generate a new self-signed authentication certificate for the Logstash server ( cd /etc/pki/tls; sudo openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private/logstash-forwarder.key -out certs/logstash-forwarder.crt  for a 10-year certificate) or (better) get a proper certificate from a commercial provider (known as a certificate authority), and keep the private key private.

outcast/kubernetes-ingress-nginxinc,True,"🚀 Help make the NGINX Ingress Controller better by participating in our  survey ! 🚀 NGINX Ingress Controller This repo provides an implementation of an Ingress controller for NGINX and NGINX Plus. Note : this project is different from the NGINX Ingress controller in  kubernetes/ingress-nginx  repo. See  this doc  to find out about the key differences. What is the Ingress? The Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that lets you configure an HTTP load balancer for applications running on Kubernetes, represented by one or more  Services . Such a load balancer is necessary to deliver those applications to clients outside of the Kubernetes cluster. The Ingress resource supports the following features: Content-based routing Host-based routing . For example, routing requests with the host header  foo.example.com  to one group of services and the host header  bar.example.com  to another group. Path-based routing . For example, routing requests with the URI that starts with  /serviceA  to service A and requests with the URI that starts with  /serviceB  to service B. TLS/SSL termination  for each hostname, such as  foo.example.com . See the  Ingress User Guide  to learn more about the Ingress resource. What is the Ingress Controller? The Ingress controller is an application that runs in a cluster and configures an HTTP load balancer according to Ingress resources. The load balancer can be a software load balancer running in the cluster or a hardware or cloud load balancer running externally. Different load balancers require different Ingress controller implementations. In the case of NGINX, the Ingress controller is deployed in a pod along with the load balancer. NGINX Ingress Controller NGINX Ingress controller works with both NGINX and NGINX Plus and supports the standard Ingress features - content-based routing and TLS/SSL termination. Additionally, several NGINX and NGINX Plus features are available as extensions to the Ingress resource via annotations and the ConfigMap resource. In addition to HTTP, NGINX Ingress controller supports load balancing Websocket, gRPC, TCP and UDP applications. See  ConfigMap  and  Annotations  docs to learn more about the supported features and customization options. As an alternative to the Ingress, NGINX Ingress controller supports the VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources. They enable use cases not supported with the Ingress resource, such as traffic splitting and advanced content-based routing. See  VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources doc . TCP, UDP and TLS Passthrough load balancing is also supported. See the  TransportServer resource doc . Read  this doc  to learn more about NGINX Ingress controller with NGINX Plus. Getting Started Install the NGINX Ingress controller using the Kubernetes  manifests  or the  helm chart . Use the Ingress resource. See the  Cafe example . Or the VirtualServer resource. See the  Basic configuration  example. See additional configuration  examples . Learn more about all available configuration and customization in the  docs . NGINX Ingress Controller Releases We publish Ingress controller releases on GitHub. See our  releases page . The latest stable release is  1.12.0 . For production use, we recommend that you choose the latest stable release.  As an alternative, you can choose the  edge  version built from the  latest commit  from the master branch. The edge version is useful for experimenting with new features that are not yet published in a stable release. To use the Ingress controller, you need to have access to: An Ingress controller image.

This example will serve a welcome page and the current hit count as stored in a database. OpenShift Origin v3 setup There are four methods to get started with OpenShift v3: Running a virtual machine with Vagrant Running a virtual machine managed by minishift Starting a Docker container Downloading the binary Running an Ansible playbook Running a virtual machine with Vagrant One option is to use the Vagrant all-in-one launch as described in the  OpenShift Origin All-In-One Virtual Machine . This option works on Mac, Windows and Linux, but requires that you install  Vagrant  running  VirtualBox . Running a virtual machine managed by minishift Another option to run virtual machine but not having to using Vagrant is to download and use the  minishift  binary as described in its  getting started  section.  minishift  can be used to spin up a VM on any of Windows, Linux or Mac with the help of supported underlying virtualization technologies like KVM, xhyve, Hyper-V, VirtualBox. Starting a Docker container Another option is running the OpenShift Origin Docker container image from  Docker Hub  launch as described in the  Getting Started for Administrators . This method is supported on Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) hosts only. Downloading the Binary Red Hat periodically publishes OpenShift Origin Server binaries for Linux, which you can download on the OpenShift Origin GitHub  Release  page. Instructions on how to install and launch the Openshift Origin Server from binary are described in  Getting Started for Administrators . Running an Ansible playbook Outlined as the  Advanced Installation  method for production environments, OpenShift Origin is also installable via Ansible playbook made available on the GitHub  openshift-ansible  repo. Creating a project After logging in with  oc login  (default username/password: openshift), if you don't have a project setup all ready, go ahead and take care of that: That's it, project has been created.  Though it would probably be good to set your current project to this (thought new-project does it automatically as well), such as: Creating new apps You can create a new OpenShift application using the web console or by running the  oc new-app  command from the CLI. With the  OpenShift CLI there are three ways to create a new application, by specifying either: source code OpenShift templates DockerHub images Create a new app from source code (method 1) Pointing  oc new-app  at source code kicks off a chain of events, for our example run: The tool will inspect the source code, locate an appropriate image on DockerHub, create an ImageStream for that image, and then create the right build configuration, deployment configuration and service definition. (The -l flag will apply a label of ""name=myapp"" to all the resources created by new-app, for easy management later.) Create a new app from a template (method 2) We can also  create new apps using OpenShift template files . Clone the demo app source code from  GitHub repo  (fork if you like). Looking at the repo, you'll notice three files in the openshift/template directory: We can create the the new app from the  nodejs.json  template by using the  -f  flag and pointing the tool at a path to the template file: Build the app oc new-app  will kick off a build once all required dependencies are confirmed. Check the status of your new nodejs app with the command: Which should return something like: Note the server address for the web console, as yours will likely differ if you're not using the Vagrant set-up. You can follow along with the web console to see what new resources have been created and watch the progress of builds and deployments. If the build is not yet started (you can check by running  oc get builds ), start one and stream the logs with: You can alternatively leave off  --follow  and use  oc logs build/nodejs-ex-n  where  n  is the number of the build to track the output of the build. Deploy the app Deployment happens automatically once the new application image is available.  To monitor its status either watch the web console or execute  oc get pods  to see when the pod is up.  Another helpful command is This will help indicate what IP address the service is running, the default port for it to deploy at is 8080. Output should look like: Configure routing An OpenShift route exposes a service at a host name, like  www.example.com , so that external clients can reach it by name. DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing; you may wish to configure a cloud domain that will always correctly resolve to the OpenShift router, or if using an unrelated host name you may need to modify its DNS records independently to resolve to the router. That aside, let's explore our new web console, which for our example is running at  https://10.2.2.2:8443 . After logging into the web console with your same CLI  oc login  credentials, click on the project we just created, then click  Create route . If you're running OpenShift on a local machine, you can preview the new app by setting the Hostname to a localhost like:  10.2.2.2 . This could also be accomplished by running: Now navigate to the newly created Node.js web app at the hostname we just configured, for our example it was simply  https://10.2.2.2 . Create a new app from an image (method 3) You may have noticed the index page ""Page view count"" reads ""No database configured"". Let's fix that by adding a MongoDB service. We could use the second OpenShift template example ( nodejs-mongodb.json ) but for the sake of demonstration let's point  oc new-app  at a DockerHub image: The  -e  flag sets the environment variables we want used in the configuration of our new app. Running  oc status  or checking the web console will reveal the address of the newly created MongoDB: Note that the url for our new Mongo instance, for our example, is  172.30.0.112:27017 , yours will likely differ. Setting environment variables To take a look at environment variables set for each pod, run  oc env pods --all --list . We need to add the environment variable  MONGO_URL  to our Node.js web app so that it will utilize our MongoDB, and enable the ""Page view count"" feature. Run: Then check  oc status  to see that an updated deployment has been kicked off: Success You should now have a Node.js welcome page showing the current hit count, as stored in a MongoDB database. Pushing updates Assuming you used the URL of your own forked repository, we can easily push changes and simply repeat the steps above which will trigger the newly built image to be deployed. Debugging Review some of the common tips and suggestions  here . Web UI To run this example from the Web UI, you can same steps following done on the CLI as defined above. Here's a video showing it in motion: Looking for help If you get stuck at some point, or think that this document needs further details or clarification, you can give feedback and look for help using the channels mentioned in  the OpenShift Origin repo , or by filing an issue.

A cross between Illustrator and Photoshop and not as dating. Airflow  - cast media on your computer to chrome cast, free! Astropad - recently fell in love with this app that lets me use my ipad as a full resolution pressure sensitve touchscreen. **Command One Pro **- if i’m spending a long time on a server doing file stuff I far prefer using an app with a GUI. I’m so bored of terminal. Enpass  &amp;  Keepass  &amp;  Hider 2  - Encryption / Keychains cloud synced  **Air Radar **- A secondary wifi app that will help you find the best wifi networks and optimise the network your connected to. This is essential for traveling. **Alfred 2 **-This is spotlight (cmd+space) on steroids. AppCleaner  - Deletes most (not all) of an app you’re trying to uninstall. Only really does a quick search but gets the job done for most things. Adobe Creative Cloud  - Because after effects. Dash - Local software manuals for when I don’t feel like sifting through hundreds of StackOverflow threads to find the answers like the correct RSYNC procedure or something minor. (every time). Amazon Cloud Drive  - Ridiculously cheap (free this year!) unlimited cloud storage. Within a matter of 2 weeks i’ve backed up everything multiple times. Have patience though, must use AWS glacier because upload / transfer times are horrendously slow. Arq  - Extremely robust and secure cloud backup. like time machine but instead of a local drive you can use Amazon Cloud or Google Drive or Dropbox et cetera. Big perk is the Backblaze cloud storage integration. B2 is so cheap and cheerful I just can’t deal! Atom  - Code editor with great plugins but can be quite slow. Beamer - Another Chromecasting app in case airflow doesn’t work Blocs  - Dead simple webpage maker with drag and drop. Good for sketching draft website / business ideas and, surprisingly, information design. Because it’s so pared back with features it forces you to focus on the content instead of getting caught up in the the fiddly design bits. Wouldn’t use in production environments. Dropbox  - Mainly use for preferences sync, quick webhosting, secure sync, and public folders Ember  - screenshot tool that lets you annotate and share snaps quickly.

Essential for big downloads that you need to start and restart **Google Drive **- file sync. Let’s be honest. If i could sync my mind with Google I would  IconJar  - Organises all of the icons on your computer to use quickly in designs.  iStatMenus  - These are the graphs and data in the menubar that let you know at a glance your system performance. I need this because a lot of my applications use a lot of system resources and I have to keep an eye on it in case the computer overheats and shuts itself off, runs out of memory, or doesn’t have diskspace left.  Pacifist  - Because System integrity protection can be annoying and because downloaded files may not be the safest. Reeder  - Beautiful RSS SiteSucker - Does what’s on the tin - really really fast and can scale for big sites. Hype 3  - very interested in this web animation toolkit. Really has potential. **Google Adwords **- for batch editing Google Adwords campaigns. Pixelmator : I don’t use it really, i think i was grandfathered into it from a bundle i bought or something. Not the biggest fan but it’s not terrible. Keka  - a decompression tool that is open source and miles better than the one built in to OSX. It ‘unzips’ more types of files as we’ll as compress files more efficiently than the built in one. Sketchbook Pro  +  Mischeif  +  Astropan  drawing / tablet apps  Little Snitch  - monitors all network requests in and out of the computer and will allow you to pick and choose what goes out on the web. This is an easy way to be malware free, it also helps keep a few installed applications from phoning home to check registration. ;-) Macaw  - The best WYSIWYG web design / prototyping tool I’ve ever used. I use it to mock up websites quickly and test out different ideas. Generally lightweight and easy to use. Is a bit too clunky for web development production environments that require a CMS but can spit out better, more effecient code than I  can for smaller, quicker projects. Omnigraffle Pro  - Hands down the best diagramming, workflow design, mind mapping and general purpose business information graphics program ever made. 1,000X easier to use than Visio - and I love Viseo.  Omniplan  - Same company as above, but the Project Planning app. I’m trying this one out, not sure how I feel about project planning software but I figured I should learn the basics. Omnioutliner  - Same company, spot the trend? This app is great for focused writing outlines and overviews. Amazing multipurpose, i typically outline here first my ideas, then diagram them in omnigraffle. Microsoft Office 360 - Because there are many imitators but nothing can best Excel. Paw - Brilliant REST application for API testing, so many features but not overwhelming. Design an API call / function in no time at all. Allows saving of different cookie ‘jars’ so you can run multiple projects and varied enviornment tests at once. The export functionality is convenient, though of course you’ll need to do a lot of manual editing. Server  -Mac OSX Server for local hosting dynamic websites and generally to see what the hell Apple is actually doing in the business world… Sketch + Toolbox  - Only recently getting into this app, i like its simplicity. Sometimes I just don’t want to open up Illustrator which feels like a cow next to this quick app. Toolbox helps keep plugins updated directly from their github master.  Snappy App  - The best screenshot app ever. It has limited functionality, is unobtrusive, and focuses on one thing great. Have been using this for years that my snaps library synced over multiple computers / profiles is in the 3000s  Sip  - The worlds best color picker. I thought i would hate the drip sound it makes when capturing colours but I’ve grown to love, almost anticipate it. Sublime Text  - Atom ripped off this text/code editor with package control. Very lightweight and snappy, prefer this to change quick bits in code documents or If I need to do a lot of manual editing of repetitive tasks. There is no other ‘find / replace all’ in any other app I’ve tried, it’s like magic watching it do it’s thing. Tor  - it’s so much better than it used to be, is based on firefox, and lets you install adblock +. I use this when I’m watching my back or just feel generally paranoid. I would make it my primary browser except that i like the convienve of all the tracking. Also, it’s really annoying that cloud flare has a vendetta against Tor users, nearly every time I go to a site with cloud flare dos I have to fill out an impossible captcha.  Transmission : Lightweight bit torrent + agent client that doesn’t have ads. VMware Fusion  - Run Windows / Linux virtual machines, fast booting, robust features. Also really helpful to use to boot up a second instance of OSX with vmware as strong sandbox to test reliability and security of a newly downloaded app. IconJar : For moving around Windows Partitions and Bootcamp partitions without loosing my mind. Virtualbox : same as vmware fusion, but far more configurable and way more easy to fuck up. I typically will create my Virtual Machine here in virtual box and then import it into VMware to bypass the huge minimum machine sized vmware has. ",[]

Install the starter kit's local  npm  and  bower  dependencies. cd  polymer-starter-kit  &amp;&amp;  npm install  &amp;&amp;  bower install This installs the element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools the starter kit requires to build and serve apps. Development workflow Serve / watch gulp serve This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network. Run tests gulp test:local This runs the unit tests defined in the  app/test  directory through  web-component-tester . To run tests Java 7 or higher is required. To update Java go to  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html  and download  JDK  and install it. Build &amp; Vulcanize gulp Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification. Application Theming &amp; Styling Polymer 1.0 introduces a shim for CSS custom properties. We take advantage of this in  app/styles/app-theme.html  to provide theming for your application. You can also find our presets for Material Design breakpoints in this file. Read more  about CSS custom properties. Styling main.css  - to define styles that can be applied outside of Polymer's custom CSS properties implementation. Some of the use-cases include defining styles that you want to be applied for a splash screen, styles for your application 'shell' before it gets upgraded using Polymer or critical style blocks that you want parsed before your elements are. app-theme.html  - to provide theming for your application. You can also find our presets for Material Design breakpoints in this file. shared-styles.html  - to share styles between elements and index.html. element styles only  - styles specific to element. These styles should be inside the  &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;  inside  template . &lt; dom-module id ="" my-list "" &gt; &lt; template &gt; &lt; style &gt; : host display : background-color : &lt;/ style &gt; &lt; ul &gt; &lt; template is ="" dom-repeat ""  items ="" {{items}} "" &gt; &lt; li &gt; &lt; span class ="" paper-font-body1 "" &gt; {{item}} &lt;/ span &gt; &lt;/ li &gt; &lt;/ template &gt; &lt;/ ul &gt; &lt;/ template &gt; &lt;/ dom-module &gt; These style files are located in the  styles folder . Unit Testing Web apps built with Polymer Starter Kit come configured with support for  Web Component Tester  - Polymer's preferred tool for authoring and running unit tests. This makes testing your element based applications a pleasant experience. Read more  about using Web Component tester. Dependency Management Polymer uses  Bower  for package management. This makes it easy to keep your elements up to date and versioned. For tooling, we use npm to manage Node.js-based dependencies. Service Worker Polymer Starter Kit offers an optional offline experience thanks to Service Worker and the  Platinum Service Worker elements . New to Service Worker? Read the following  introduction  to understand how it works. Our optional offline setup should work well for relatively simple applications. For more complex apps, we recommend learning how Service Worker works so that you can make the most of the Platinum Service Worker element abstractions. Enable Service Worker support? To enable Service Worker support for Polymer Starter Kit project use these 3 steps: Uncomment Service Worker code in index.html &lt;!-- Uncomment next block to enable Service Worker support (1/2) --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;paper-toast id=""caching-complete""              duration=""6000""              text=""Caching complete! This app will work offline.""&gt; &lt;/paper-toast&gt; &lt;platinum-sw-register auto-register                       clients-claim                       skip-waiting                       on-service-worker-installed=""displayInstalledToast""&gt;   &lt;platinum-sw-cache default-cache-strategy=""networkFirst""                      cache-config-file=""precache.json""&gt;   &lt;/platinum-sw-cache&gt; &lt;/platinum-sw-register&gt; --&gt; Uncomment Service Worker code in elements.html &lt;!-- Uncomment next block to enable Service Worker Support (2/2) --&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;link rel=""import"" href=""../bower_components/platinum-sw/platinum-sw-cache.html""&gt; &lt;link rel=""import"" href=""../bower_components/platinum-sw/platinum-sw-register.html""&gt; --&gt; Uncomment 'cache-config' in the  runSequence() (gulpfile.js) // Build Production Files, the Default Task gulp . task ( 'default' , [ 'clean' ] , function ( cb ) { runSequence ( [ 'copy' , 'styles' ] , 'elements' , [ 'jshint' , 'images' , 'fonts' , 'html' ] , 'vulcanize' , 'cache-config' , cb ) ; } ) ; Filing bugs in the right place If you experience an issue with Service Worker support in your application, check the origin of the issue and use the appropriate issue tracker: sw-toolbox platinum-sw platinum-push-notifications-manager For all other issues, feel free to file them  here . I get an error message about ""Only secure origins are allowed"" Service Workers are only available to ""secure origins"" (HTTPS sites, basically) in line with a policy to prefer secure origins for powerful new features. However  http://localhost  is also considered a secure origin, so if you can, developing on localhost is an easy way to avoid this error. For production, your site will need to support HTTPS. How do I debug Service Worker? If you need to debug the event listener wire-up use  chrome://serviceworker-internals . What are those buttons on chrome://serviceworker-internals? This page shows your registered workers and provides some basic operations. Unregister: Unregisters the worker. Start: Starts the worker. This would happen automatically when you navigate to a page in the worker's scope. Stop: Stops the worker. Sync: Dispatches a 'sync' event to the worker. If you don't handle this event, nothing will happen. Push: Dispatches a 'push' event to the worker. If you don't handle this event, nothing will happen. Inspect: Opens the worker in the Inspector. Development flow In order to guarantee that the latest version of your Service Worker script is being used, follow these instructions: After you made changes to your service worker script, close all but one of the tabs pointing to your web application Hit shift-reload to bypass the service worker as to ensure that the remaining tab isn't under the control of a service worker Hit reload to let the newer version of the Service Worker control the page. If you find anything to still be stale, you can also try navigating to  chrome:serviceworker-internals  (in Chrome), finding the relevant Service Worker entry for your application and clicking 'Unregister' before refreshing your app. This will (of course) only clear it from the local development machine. If you have already deployed to production then further work will be necessary to remove it from your user's machines. Disable Service Worker support after you enabled it If for any reason you need to disable Service Worker support after previously enabling it, you can remove it from your Polymer Starter Kit project using these 4 steps: Remove references to the platinum-sw elements from your application  index . Remove the two Platinum Service Worker elements (platinum-sw/..) in  app/elements/elements.html Remove 'precache' from the list in the 'default' gulp task ( gulpfile.js ) Navigate to  chrome://serviceworker-internals  and unregister any Service Workers registered by Polymer Starter Kit for your app just in case there's a copy of it cached. Yeoman support generator-polymer  now includes support for Polymer Starter Kit out of the box. Frequently Asked Questions Where do I customise my application theme? Theming can be achieved using  CSS Custom properties  via  app/styles/app-theme.html app/styles/main.css  for pure CSS stylesheets (e.g for global styles), however note that Custom properties will not work there under the shim. A  Polycast  is also available that walks through theming using Polymer 1.0. Where do I configure routes in my application? This can be done via  app/elements/routing.html &lt;iron-pages&gt;  page to display based on the  selected  route. Why are we using Page.js rather than a declarative router like  &lt;more-routing&gt; ? &lt;more-routing&gt; &lt;more-routing&gt; Where can I find the application layouts from your Google I/O 2015 talk? App layouts live in a separate repository called  app-layout-templates elements.html  import. Something has failed during installation. How do I fix this? fixing npm permissions sudo If you run into an exception that mentions five optional dependencies failing (or an  EEXIST bug npm install npm@2.11.0 -g C:\Program Files\ . Updating npm by running  npm install npm@2.11.0 -g %AppData%\npm , but your system will still use the npm version. You can avoid this by deleting your older npm from  C:\Program Files\nodejs here . npm cache clean  and deleting the  node_modules npm install  to see if this corrects the problem. If not, please check the  issue tracker I'm having trouble getting Vulcanize to fully build my project on Windows. Help? Some Windows users have run into trouble with the  elements.vulcanized.html  file in their  dist There is also an  in-flight inlineCss How do I add new JavaScript files to Starter Kit so they're picked up by the build process? At the bottom of  app/index.html Below, we've added in  script2.js  and  script3.js &lt;!-- build:js scripts/app.js --&gt;  specifies that these scripts will be squashed into  scripts/app.js &lt;!-- build:js scripts/app.js --&gt; &lt; script src ="" scripts/app.js "" &gt; &lt;/ script &gt; &lt; script src ="" scripts/script2.js "" &gt; &lt;/ script &gt; &lt; script src ="" scripts/script3.js "" &gt; &lt;/ script &gt; &lt;!-- endbuild--&gt; If you are not using the build-blocks, but still wish for additional files (e.g scripts or stylesheets) to be included in the final  dist  directory, you will need to either copy these files as part of the gulpfile.js build process (see the  copy  task for how to automate this) or manually copy the files. I'm finding the installation/tooling here overwhelming. What should I do? Don't worry! We've got your covered. Polymer Starter Kit tries to offer everything you need to build and optimize your apps for production, which is why we include the tooling we do. We realise however that our tooling setup may not be for everyone. If you find that you just want the simplest setup possible, we recommend using Polymer Starter Kit light, which is available from the  Releases  page. This takes next to no time to setup. Licensing Like other Google projects, Polymer Starter Kit includes Google license headers at the top of several of our source files. Google's open-source licensing requires that this header be kept in place (sorry!), however we acknowledge that you may need to add your own licensing to files you modify. This can be done by appending your own extensions to these headers. Contributing Polymer Starter Kit is a new project and is an ongoing effort by the Web Component community. We welcome your bug reports, PRs for improvements, docs and anything you think would improve the experience for other Polymer developers.","[{'programming_language': 'HTML', 'percentage': 67.0}, {'programming_language': 'JavaScript', 'percentage': 31.5}, {'programming_language': 'CSS', 'percentage': 1.5}]"

Logstash core will continue to exist under this repository and all related issues and pull requests can be submitted here. Need Help? #logstash on freenode IRC logstash-users on Google Groups Logstash Documentation Logstash Product Information Elastic Support Developing Logstash uses  JRuby  which gets embedded in the  vendor/jruby/  directory. It is recommended but not mandatory that you also use JRuby as your local Ruby interpreter and for this you should consider using a Ruby version manager such as  RVM  or  rbenv . It is possible to run the rake tasks and the  bin/  commands without having JRuby locally installed in which case the embedded JRuby will be used automatically. If you have a local JRuby installed you can force logstash to use your local JRuby instead of the embedded JRuby with the  USE_RUBY=1  environment variable. To get started, make sure you have a local JRuby or Ruby version 1.9.x or above with the  rake  tool installed. On Windows  make sure to set the  JAVA_HOME  environment variable to the path to your JDK installation directory. For example  set JAVA_HOME=&lt;JDK_PATH&gt; To run logstash from the repo you must bootstrap the environment or bootstrap &amp; install the core plugins required to run the tests To verify your environment, run  bin/logstash version  which should look like this Testing For testing you can use the  test rake  tasks and the  bin/rspec  command, see instructions below. Note that the  bin/logstash rspec  command has been replaced by  bin/rspec . Core tests 1- In order to run the core tests, a small set of plugins must first be installed: 2- To run the logstash core tests you can use the rake task: or use the  rspec  tool to run all tests or run a specific test: Note that if a plugin is installed using the plugin manager  bin/plugin install ...  do not forget to also install the plugins development dependencies using the following command after the plugin installation: Plugins tests To run the tests of all currently installed plugins: You can install the default set of plugins included in the logstash package or all plugins: Note that if a plugin is installed using the plugin manager  bin/plugin install ...  do not forget to also install the plugins development dependencies using the following command after the plugin installation: Developing plugins The documentation for developing plugins can be found in the plugins README, see our example plugins: https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-example https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-filter-example https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-example https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-codec-example Drip Launcher Drip  is a tool which help solve the slow JVM startup problem. The drip script is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the java command. We recommend using drip during development, in particular for running tests. Using drip, the first invokation of a command will not be faster but the subsequent commands will be swift. To tell logstash to use drip, either set the  USE_DRIP=1  environment variable or set  JAVACMD=`which drip` . Examples: Caveats Drip does not work with STDIN. You cannot use drip for running configs which uses the stdin plugin. Building You can build a logstash package as tarball or zip file You can also build .rpm and .deb, but the  fpm  tool is required. Project Principles Community: If a newbie has a bad time, it's a bug. Software: Make it work, then make it right, then make it fast. Technology: If it doesn't do a thing today, we can make it do it tomorrow. Contributing It is more important to me that you are able to contribute.

Grav comes with a powerful  Package Management System  to allow for simple installation and upgrading of plugins and themes, as well as simple updating of Grav itself. The underlying architecture of Grav is designed to use well-established and  best-in-class  technologies to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include: Twig Templating : for powerful control of the user interface Markdown : for easy content creation YAML : for simple configuration Parsedown : for fast Markdown and Markdown Extra support Doctrine Cache : layer for performance Pimple Dependency Injection Container : for extensibility and maintainability Symfony Event Dispatcher : for plugin event handling Symfony Console : for CLI interface Gregwar Image Library : for dynamic image manipulation Requirements PHP 5.4 or higher. Check the  required modules list Check the  Apache  or  IIS  requirements QuickStart You have two options to get Grav: Downloading a Grav Package You can download a  ready-built  package from the  Downloads page on http://getgrav.org From GitHub Clone the Grav repository from  https://github.com/getgrav/grav  to a folder in the webroot of your server, e.g.  ~/webroot/grav . Launch a  terminal  or  console  and navigate to the webroot folder: Install the  plugin  and  theme dependencies  by using the  Grav CLI application bin/grav : Check out the  install procedures  for more information. Adding Functionality You can download  plugins  or  themes  manually from the appropriate tab on the  Downloads page on http://getgrav.org , but the preferred solution is to use the  Grav Package Manager  or  GPM : This will display all the available plugins and then you can install one or more with: Updating To update Grav you should use the  Grav Package Manager  or  GPM : To update plugins and themes: Contributing All our projects follow the  GitFlow branching model , from development to release. If you are not familiar with it, there are several guides and tutorials to make you understand what it is about. You will probably want to get started by installing  this very good collection of git extensions . What you mainly want to know is that: All the main activity happens in the  develop  branch. Any pull request should be addressed only to that branch. We will not consider pull requests made to the  master . It's very well appreciated, and highly suggested, to start a new feature whenever you want to make changes or add functionalities.

gabrielpconceicao/Neck-PoC,True,Neck-PoC Repository for PoC proposes related to Neck multi-browser tests bridge,[]
gabrielpconceicao/neck,True,"Neck A multi-browser test tool that fills the gap between headless and head-only browser-driven tests. How does it work? We have: Heads - Browsers that could run tests into. Neck - Neck :) Body - Things you want to test. Legs and arms - Test units, some cases are so random that causes kicks and punches into heads. Developers call them  bugs . Instalation Step 1: Start a Neck server 	npm install --save neck ; #  start Neck server ; #  Neck is now running on http://localhost:5000 Step 2: Connect some devices Access from a browser to:  http://neck.server.ip.address:5000 Step 3: Run tests! See  API  and  EXAMPLES  for further implement information. Developing Stage Developing our first pre-release Ownership Neck  is an open-source project started and owned by  findhit findhit's github page  for more projects.",[]

gabrielpconceicao/typeahead.js,True,"typeahead.js Inspired by  twitter.com 's autocomplete search functionality, typeahead.js is a fast and  fully-featured  autocomplete library. Getting Started How you acquire typeahead.js is up to you. Preferred method: Install with  Bower :  $ bower install typeahead.js Other methods: Download zipball of latest release . Download latest  typeahead.js  or  typeahead.min.js . Note:  typeahead.js has a dependency on  jQuery  1.9+, which must be loaded before  typeahead.js . Examples For some working examples of typeahead.js, visit our  examples page . Features Displays suggestions to end-users as they type Shows top suggestion as a hint (i.e. background text) Works with hardcoded data as well as remote data Rate-limits network requests to lighten the load Allows for suggestions to be drawn from multiple datasets Supports customized templates for suggestions Plays nice with RTL languages and input method editors Why not use X? At the time Twitter was looking to implement a typeahead, there wasn't a solution that allowed for prefetching data, searching that data on the client, and then falling back to the server. It's optimized for quickly indexing and searching large datasets on the client. That allows for sites without datacenters on every continent to provide a consistent level of performance for all their users. It plays nicely with Right-To-Left (RTL) languages and Input Method Editors (IMEs). We also needed something instrumented for comprehensive analytics in order to optimize relevance through A/B testing. Although logging and analytics are not currently included, it's something we may add in the future. Usage API jQuery#typeahead(datasets) Turns any  input[type=""text""]  element into a typeahead.  datasets  is expected to be a single  dataset  or an array of datasets. // single dataset $ ( 'input.typeahead-devs' ) . typeahead ( { name :  'accounts' , local :  [ 'timtrueman' , 'JakeHarding' , 'vskarich' ] } ) ; // multiple datasets $ ( 'input.twitter-search' ) . typeahead ( [ { name :  'accounts' , prefetch :  'https://twitter.com/network.json' , remote :  'https://twitter.com/accounts?q=%QUERY' } , { name :  'trends' , prefetch :  'https://twitter.com/trends.json' } ] ) ; jQuery#typeahead('destroy') Destroys previously initialized typeaheads. This entails reverting DOM modifications and removing event handlers. $ ( 'input.typeahead-devs' ) . typeahead ( { name :  'accounts' , local :  [ 'timtrueman' , 'JakeHarding' , 'vskarich' ] } ) ; $ ( 'input.typeahead-devs' ) . typeahead ( 'destroy' ) ; jQuery#typeahead('setQuery', query) Sets the current query of the typeahead. This is always preferable to using  $(""input.typeahead"").val(query) , which will result in unexpected behavior. To clear the query, simply set it to an empty string. Dataset A dataset is an object that defines a set of data that hydrates suggestions. Typeaheads can be backed by multiple datasets. Given a query, a typeahead instance will inspect its backing datasets and display relevant suggestions to the end-user. When defining a dataset, the following options are available: name  – The string used to identify the dataset. Used by typeahead.js to cache intelligently. valueKey  – The key used to access the value of the datum in the datum object. Defaults to  value . limit  – The max number of suggestions from the dataset to display for a given query. Defaults to  5 . template  – The template used to render suggestions. Can be a string or a precompiled template. If not provided, suggestions will render as their value contained in a  &lt;p&gt;  element (i.e.  &lt;p&gt;value&lt;/p&gt; ). engine  – The template engine used to compile/render  template  if it is a string. Any engine can use used as long as it adheres to the  expected API .  Required  if  template  is a string. header  – The header rendered before suggestions in the dropdown menu. Can be either a DOM element or HTML. footer  – The footer rendered after suggestions in the dropdown menu. Can be either a DOM element or HTML. local  – An array of  datums . prefetch  – Can be a URL to a JSON file containing an array of datums or, if more configurability is needed, a  prefetch options object . remote  – Can be a URL to fetch suggestions from when the data provided by  local  and  prefetch  is insufficient or, if more configurability is needed, a  remote options object . Datum The individual units that compose datasets are called datums. The canonical form of a datum is an object with a  value  property and a  tokens  property.  value  is the string that represents the underlying value of the datum and  tokens  is a collection of  single-word  strings that aid typeahead.js in matching datums with a given query. { value :  '@JakeHarding' , tokens :  [ 'Jake' , 'Harding' ] } For ease of use, datums can also be represented as a string. Strings found in place of datum objects are implicitly converted to a datum object. When datums are rendered as suggestions, the datum object is the context passed to the template engine. This means if you include any arbitrary properties in datum objects, those properties will be available to the template used to render suggestions. &lt; img src ="" {{profileImageUrl}} "" &gt; &lt; p &gt; &lt; strong &gt; {{name}} &lt;/ strong &gt; &amp;nbsp;{{value}} &lt;/ p &gt; { value :  '@JakeHarding' , tokens :  [ 'Jake' , 'Harding' ] , name :  'Jake Harding' , profileImageUrl :  'https://twitter.com/JakeHaridng/profile_img' } Prefetch Prefetched data is fetched and processed on initialization. If the browser supports localStorage, the processed data will be cached there to prevent additional network requests on subsequent page loads. When configuring  prefetch , the following options are available: url  – A URL to a JSON file containing an array of datums.  Required. ttl  – The time (in milliseconds) the prefetched data should be cached in localStorage. Defaults to  86400000  (1 day). filter  – A function with the signature  filter(parsedResponse)  that transforms the response body into an array of datums. Expected to return an array of datums. Remote Remote data is only used when the data provided by  local  and  prefetch  is insufficient. In order to prevent an obscene number of requests being made to remote endpoint, typeahead.js rate-limits remote requests. When configuring  remote , the following options are available: url  – A URL to make requests to when when the data provided by  local  and  prefetch  is insufficient.  Required. dataType  – The type of data you're expecting from the server. See the  jQuery.ajax docs  for more info. Defaults to  json . cache  – Determines whether or not the browser will cache responses. See the  jQuery.ajax docs  for more info. timeout  – Sets a timeout for requests. See the  jQuery.ajax docs  for more info. wildcard  – The pattern in  url  that will be replaced with the user's query when a request is made. Defaults to  %QUERY . replace  – A function with the signature  replace(url, uriEncodedQuery)  that can be used to override the request URL. Expected to return a valid URL. If set, no wildcard substitution will be performed on  url . rateLimitFn  – The function used for rate-limiting network requests. Can be either  debounce  or  throttle . Defaults to  debounce . rateLimitWait  – The time interval in milliseconds that will be used by  rateLimitFn . Defaults to  300 . maxParallelRequests  – The max number of parallel requests typeahead.js can have pending. Defaults to  6 . beforeSend  – A pre-request callback with the signature  beforeSend(jqXhr, settings) . Can be used to set custom headers. See the  jQuery.ajax docs  for more info. filter  – A function with the signature  filter(parsedResponse)  that transforms the response body into an array of datums. Expected to return an array of datums. Custom Events typeahead.js triggers the following custom events: typeahead:initialized  – Triggered after initialization. If data needs to be prefetched, this event will not be triggered until after the prefetched data is processed. typeahead:opened  – Triggered when the dropdown menu of a typeahead is opened. typeahead:closed  – Triggered when the dropdown menu of a typeahead is closed. typeahead:selected  – Triggered when a suggestion from the dropdown menu is explicitly selected. The datum for the selected suggestion is passed to the event handler as an argument in addition to the name of the dataset it originated from. typeahead:autocompleted  – Triggered when the query is autocompleted. The datum used for autocompletion is passed to the event handler as an argument in addition to the name of the dataset it originated from. All custom events are triggered on the element initialized as a typeahead. Template Engine Compatibility Any template engine will work with typeahead.js as long as it adheres to the following API: // engine has a compile function that returns a compiled template var compiledTemplate = ENGINE . compile ( template ) ; // compiled template has a render function that returns the rendered template // render function expects the context to be first argument passed to it var html = compiledTemplate . render ( context ) ; Check out  Hogan.js  if you're looking for a compatible mustache templating engine. Look and Feel The styles applied by typeahead.js are for positioning the hint and the dropdown menu, no other styles should be affected. In most cases the styles applied by typeahead.js will work like a charm, but there are edge cases where some custom styles will be necessary. If you're having CSS issues, create an  issue  or tweet  @typeahead  for support. By default, the dropdown menu created by typeahead.js is going to look ugly and you'll want to style it to ensure it fits into the theme of your web page. Below is a Mustache template describing the DOM structure of a typeahead.js dropdown menu. Note that the  {{{html}}}  tag is the HTML generated by the custom template you provide when defining datasets. &lt; span class ="" tt-dropdown-menu "" &gt; &lt; div class ="" tt-dataset-{{name}} "" &gt; &lt; span class ="" tt-suggestions "" &gt; &lt; div class ="" tt-suggestion "" &gt; {{{html}}} &lt;/ div &gt; &lt;/ span &gt; &lt;/ div &gt; &lt;/ span &gt; When an end-user mouses or keys over a  .tt-suggestion , the class  tt-is-under-cursor  will be added to it. You can use this class as a hook for styling the ""under cursor"" state of suggestions. Bootstrap Integration For simple autocomplete use cases, the typeahead component  Bootstrap  provides should suffice. However, if you'd prefer to take advantage of some of the advance features typeahead.js provides, here's what you'll need to do to integrate typeahead.js with Bootstrap: If you're customizing Bootstrap, exclude the typeahead component. If you're depending on the standard  bootstrap.js , ensure  typeahead.js  is loaded after it. The DOM structure of the dropdown menu used by typeahead.js differs from the DOM structure of the Bootstrap dropdown menu. You'll need to load some  additional CSS  in order to get the typeahead.js dropdown menu to fit the default Bootstrap theme.

History See the  History.md  file for a detailed list of features, changes, solved issues and bugs Involve Please create an issue if something doesn't work or if there is a browser specific bug. I'll try to fix it as soon as possible. Please send me your Pull requests if you have a nice solution! I'm also going to review old issues in balupton's repository and try to solve them too. Aims Follow the  HTML5 History API  as much as possible Provide a cross-compatible experience for all HTML5 Browsers (they all implement the HTML5 History API a little bit differently causing different behaviours and sometimes bugs - History.js fixes this ensuring the experience is as expected / the same / great throughout the HTML5 browsers) Provide a backwards-compatible experience for all HTML4 Browsers using a hash-fallback (including continued support for the HTML5 History API's  data ,  title ,  pushState  and  replaceState ) with the option to  remove HTML4 support if it is not right for your application Provide a forwards-compatible experience for HTML4 States to HTML5 States (so if a hash-fallbacked url is accessed by a HTML5 browser it is naturally transformed into its non-hashed url equivalent) Provide support for as many javascript frameworks as possible via adapters; especially  Dojo ,  ExtJS ,  jQuery ,  MooTools ,  Right.js  and  Zepto . Quick Install Via Ajaxify Script To ajaxify your entire website with the HTML5 History API, History.js and jQuery the  Ajaxify script  is all you need. It's that easy. Via Ajaxify Extension If you don't have access to your server, or just want to try out the Ajaxify script first, you can install the  History.js It! Google Chrome Extension  to try out History.js via Ajaxify on select websites without actually installing History.js/Ajaxify on your server. Via Ruby On Rails Gem If you are using Rails, then the easiest way for you to try History.js would be to use  Wiselinks  gem. Wiselinks integrates  into Rails application and allows you to start using History.js with three lines of code. Direct Install Working with History.js directly ( function ( window , undefined ) { // Bind to StateChange Event History . Adapter . bind ( window , 'statechange' , function ( ) { // Note: We are using statechange instead of popstate var State = History . getState ( ) ; // Note: We are using History.getState() instead of event.state } ) ; // Change our States History . pushState ( { state : 1 } , ""State 1"" , ""?state=1"" ) ; // logs {state:1}, ""State 1"", ""?state=1"" History . pushState ( { state : 2 } , ""State 2"" , ""?state=2"" ) ; // logs {state:2}, ""State 2"", ""?state=2"" History . replaceState ( { state : 3 } , ""State 3"" , ""?state=3"" ) ; // logs {state:3}, ""State 3"", ""?state=3"" History . pushState ( null , null , ""?state=4"" ) ; // logs {}, '', ""?state=4"" History . back ( ) ; // logs {state:3}, ""State 3"", ""?state=3"" History . back ( ) ; // logs {state:1}, ""State 1"", ""?state=1"" History . back ( ) ; // logs {}, ""Home Page"", ""?"" History . go ( 2 ) ; // logs {state:3}, ""State 3"", ""?state=3"" } ) ( window ) ; How would the above operations look in a HTML5 Browser? www.mysite.com www.mysite.com/?state=1 www.mysite.com/?state=2 www.mysite.com/?state=3 www.mysite.com/?state=4 www.mysite.com/?state=3 www.mysite.com/?state=1 www.mysite.com www.mysite.com/?state=3 Note: These urls also work in HTML4 browsers and Search Engines. So no need for the hashbang ( #! ) fragment-identifier that google  ""recommends"" . How would they look in a HTML4 Browser? www.mysite.com www.mysite.com/#?state=1&amp;_suid=1 www.mysite.com/#?state=2&amp;_suid=2 www.mysite.com/#?state=3&amp;_suid=3 www.mysite.com/#?state=4 www.mysite.com/#?state=3&amp;_suid=3 www.mysite.com/#?state=1&amp;_suid=1 www.mysite.com www.mysite.com/#?state=3&amp;_suid=3 Note 1: These urls also work in HTML5 browsers - we use  replaceState  to transform these HTML4 states into their HTML5 equivalents so the user won't even notice :-) Note 2: These urls will be automatically url-encoded in IE6 to prevent certain browser-specific bugs. Note 3: Support for HTML4 browsers (this hash fallback) is optional  - why supporting HTML4 browsers could be either good or bad based on my app's use cases What's the deal with the SUIDs used in the HTML4 States? SUIDs (State Unique Identifiers) are used when we utilise a  title  and/or  data  in our state. Adding a SUID allows us to associate particular states with data and titles while keeping the urls as simple as possible (don't worry it's all tested, working and a lot smarter than I'm making it out to be). If you aren't utilising  title  or  data  then we don't even include a SUID (as there is no need for it) - as seen by State 4 above :-) We also shrink the urls to make sure that the smallest url will be used. For instance we will adjust  http://www.mysite.com/#http://www.mysite.com/projects/History.js  to become  http://www.mysite.com/#/projects/History.js  automatically. (again tested, working, and smarter). It works with domains, subdomains, subdirectories, whatever - doesn't matter where you put it. It's smart. Safari 5 will also have a SUID appended to the URL, it is entirely transparent but just a visible side-effect. It is required to fix a bug with Safari 5. Is there a working demo? Sure is, give it a download and navigate to the demo directory in your browser :-) If you are after something a bit more adventurous than a end-user demo, open up the tests directory in your browser and editor - it'll rock your world and show all the vast use cases that History.js supports.

When a new session opens a familiar state (via the SUID or the URL) and it is not found locally then it will attempt to load the last known stored state with that information. URLs will be unescaped to the maximum, so for instance the URL  ?key=a%20b%252c  will become  ?key=a b c . This is to ensure consistency between browser url encodings. Changing the hash of the page causes  onpopstate window.onstatechange : this is the same as the  onpopstate  event except it does not fire for traditional anchors window.onanchorchange : this is the same as the  onhashchange  event except it does not fire for states History You can discover the history inside the  History.md  file License Licensed under the  New BSD License Copyright ©  2011+  Benjamin Arthur Lupton b@lupton.cc",[]

gabrielpconceicao/hoverMobile,True,"hoverMobile.js : Javascript Library to simulate the hover effect on a mobile device This javascript library simulates the hover effect on mobile devices, with a pointer only by moving your finger on the lcd. Example 1 Example 2 See the example on your mobile device at  http://www.gabrielconceicao.com/hoverMobile http://www.gabrielconceicao.com/ How it works? When the user presses the lcd three times very quickly, a pointer will show up and he can move his finger to the element with some hover effect and see that effect, like at desktop. If the element has some javascript ""on hover"" code, it will run too, with a listener. When he stops pressing the lcd, the pointer dissapears. The only three things necessary to work are: Add this library to your website; Define a .hover class on every element with a :hover pseudo class and copy the same logic. On your hover listeners, define the touchenter and touchleave events.  The library will fire the event touchenter when he is hover the element and fire touchleave when it leaves the element. The :hover css pseudo class effect: How it works in mobile with this library? All you have to do is create a new class like this: Javascript:  With this library what is necessary to the mouseover event work on mobile devices? Simple define the touchenter and touchleave events at elements and the library will fire the events. Example:  Options and intialization  You can start this library, calling the start function with this parameters: The parameter ""animateEls"" defines what elements of the dom will show up the effect. https://github.com/gabrielpconceicao/hoverMobile/blob/master/index.html#L33 This library depends of gO.library.

liqiang0330/spider_demo,True,"spider_demo 个人爬虫练习代码，一点点总结上传。 一、wenshu的 js hook 可以找到加密参数发送请求前的位置，从而根据debugger位置，打断点找到加密入口。具体的加密在一点点进行中。 也可以根据这个不破解加密的具体方法。 1、通过  js hook  到  XMLHttpRequest  的请求， 2、判断请求中是否有加密参数 3、取消请求 4、将获取到的加密参数以及  cookie  返回到爬虫程序。返回通过谷歌插件的形式。 5、就可以实现抓取了 还有一种思路是自己执行  XMLHttpRequest  发送请求，并执行拦截和取消。这种思路的话生成加密参数的速度应该是最快的。不过我不太清楚这种自己制造自己拦截具体是怎么操作的。如果有知道的，可以指点一下。谢谢！ 增加抓取数据的处理逻辑，并将抓取的数据保存到  mongodb  数据库中。增加验证码手动处理。 需要修改优化的部分： 将详情处理与列表的处理分开，详情做多线程或者异步协程抓取。 增加  redis  处理，实现分布式增加去重抓取 增加代理  ip  池 加密的参数具体破解还在一步步解析中 二、wenshu app 的逆向 这个真的简单。而且网上到处都有。 三、 FaceBook js破解 四、KuGouTop500 五、duapp_unidbg 调用 so 在大佬  @zhaoboy9692  代码上做了简单的修改 六、中华人民共和国行政区划（五级）：省级、地级、县级、乡级和村级。 关于更新全国统计用区划代码和城乡划分代码的公告 使用  python  重新实现了一下，代码比较简单，由于没有代理ip，没有进行多线程也没有异步还是挺慢的，而且会有频率限制。所以建议可以上代理ip，这样会非常快。也没有保存相关的  code  ,我只需要名字，所以就只保存了名字。使用  MySQL  保存。 这个数据太多了，又用  scrapy-redis 重新实现了一遍。我只是单机跑，速度其实还不是很快。可以多部署几台去抓就快多了。五级的数据是在是多，四级的话会少很多。 AreaSpider 文件夹下的 area 文件夹。执行  main.py  就可以了。然后再  redis 中  push  一条起始数据就 OK 了。 需要注意的问题就是一个电脑抓的太频繁就会出现一个频率太快，会禁止你的请求，可以等几秒后。还有一个就是会出现  sojson.v5  的 js,其实这个还原之后你会发现就是生成了  cookie  中的一个参数。可以选择破解  sojson.v5  也可以直接复制  cookie  控制一下请求的频率就可以。 保存的数据预览 id pid name level 1 0 中国 0 2 1 北京市 1 3 1 天津市 1 4 1 河北省 1 5 1 山西省 1 ... ... ... ... 33 2 市辖区 2 34 33 东城区 3 35 34 东华门街道 4 36 35 多福巷社区居委会 5 ... ... ... ... 大家可以直接下载  sql  文件。也可以直接修改代码重新自己抓取一份。sql 文件在 AreaSpider 目录下。总共数据有将近70万的数据。我对第五级的数据进行了处理，原本都是居委会等等，把居委会。。删除后保存的。 area_spider.sql  文件大小  56.9MB 七、qcc 请求频繁类似 ob 的 js 。以及登陆 qcc 请求频繁会直接返回一个 混淆 js, 这个 js 会生成一个新的 cookie的值，更新到cookie中。 qcc_ob_js/qcc_cookie_parse_16.js  已经做了处理，使用 AST做的处理，参考蔡老板的文章，该文件可以直接在 node环境下运行，使用 express 做服务。需要安装相关的库。 访问方式 ： http://127.0.0.1:3000/?arg1={arg1} 登陆就是个阿里的滑动，晚点放个 demo。特别简单，百度就有。","[{'programming_language': 'TSQL', 'percentage': 96.7}, {'programming_language': 'HTML', 'percentage': 3.2}]"

This project temporarily provides both a telegram bot and a locally hosted web page, correspondingly for mobile users and for PC users as interfaces. This library fetches information from various websites, but most of them are blocked in some regions. To experience a better travel, please host the service in somewhere having lesser Internet restrictions, like the USA, Japan, etc. In brief, there are 3 main instructions concluded below. It is for searching Japanese AVs. It provides 2 interfaces: telegram bot and web. Use VPN if you experience network issues. Web Configurations ip-whitelist  and  password 如果你将服务部署在一个远程机器 ，像是云虚拟专用服务器上，你可能会担心网站被其他未经许可的人访问。在 0.2.5 发布版后，JavPy会自动创建一个配置文件 ~/.JavPy/config.json 。你可以 将你的私人ip或ip段 添加到文件中，并 创建一个密码 。未被认证的访问将被拦截并得到一个400错误响应。你也可以在页面左上角的设置按钮配置选项。 If you want to run the server on a remote machine  like a cloud VPS, you may be worry about the website being accessed by unauthorised people. After release  0.2.5 , JavPy will automatically create a configuration file   ~/.JavPy/config.json  on its first run. You can  add your personal IPs or IP ranges  into the file and  create a password . Unauthorised access will then be blocked and get a response of Error 400. You can also set the configuration with the settings button on the top left of tha web page. proxy 如果你需要使用代理，请在 ~/.JavPy/config.json 中设置 proxy 这一项，目前可以支持socks5与http代理 例子： proxy: ""http://127.0.0.1:1080"" If you need to use a proxy, simply set the  proxy  field in the  ~/.JavPy/config.json . Currently both socks5 and http proxies are supported. Example:  proxy: ""http://127.0.0.1:1080"" **注意：**若使用docker进行服务，请务必记得在退出docker前将config文件保存，不管是通过 docker cp 进行备份或通过 docker commit 提交修改。 Attention:  If you are serving with docker, please don't forget to save your config file before exiting the container. You can either backup the config file with  docker cp  or save your changes into an image with  docker commit .

davidadamojr/kit,True,"kit KeepInTouch (kit) is an Android app that lets you set daily, weekly, biweekly and monthly reminders to call people. The app serves as a good project for learning about ContentProviders and AlarmManager. Bugs The basic code for the app is written but the project is quite incomplete. There are a number of major bugs. When multiple reminders are set, only the most recent reminder is triggered at the specified interval. This bug definitely stems from improper use of Android Alarms/AlarmManager. After reminder intervals are selected from the contact list, the reminder interval labels repeat randomly down the list due to Android list item recycling. This is a UI issue. It would be interesting if someone decides to squash these major bugs. I bet there are other bugs lurking around in there as well. Development on this project has come to a halt.

professorhaseeb/angular-loading-bar,True,"angular-loading-bar The idea is simple: Add a loading bar / progress bar whenever an XHR request goes out in angular.  Multiple requests within the same time period get bundled together such that each response increments the progress bar by the appropriate amount. This is mostly cool because you simply include it in your app, and it works.  There's no complicated setup, and no need to maintain the state of the loading bar; it's all handled automatically by the interceptor. Requirements:  AngularJS 1.2+ File Size:  2.4Kb minified, 0.5Kb gzipped Usage: include the loading bar as a dependency for your app.  If you want animations, include  ngAnimate  as well.  note: ngAnimate is optional angular . module ( 'myApp' , [ 'angular-loading-bar' , 'ngAnimate' ] ) include the supplied JS and CSS file (or create your own CSS to override defaults). &lt; link rel =' stylesheet '  href =' build/loading-bar.min.css '  type =' text/css '  media =' all &lt; script type =' text/javascript '  src =' build/loading-bar.min.js ' &gt; &lt;/ script &gt; That's it -- you're done! via bower: via npm: via CDN: &lt; link rel =' stylesheet '  href =' //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-loading-bar/0.9.0/loading-bar.min.css '  type =' text/css '  media =' all &lt; script type =' text/javascript '  src =' //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-loading-bar/0.9.0/loading-bar.min.js ' &gt; &lt;/ script &gt; Why I created this There are a couple projects similar to this out there, but none were ideal for me.  All implementations I've seen require that you maintain state on behalf of the loading bar.  In other words, you're setting the value of the loading/progress bar manually from potentially many different locations.  This becomes complicated when you have a very large application with several services all making independent XHR requests. It becomes even more complicated if you want these services to be loosly coupled. Additionally, Angular was created as a highly testable framework, so it pains me to see Angular modules without tests.  That is not the case here as this loading bar ships with 100% code coverage. Goals for this project: Make it automatic Unit tests, 100% coverage Must work well with ngAnimate Must be styled via external CSS (not inline) No jQuery dependencies Configuration Turn the spinner on or off: The insertion of the spinner can be controlled through configuration.  It's on by default, but if you'd like to turn it off, simply configure the service: angular . module ( 'myApp' , [ 'angular-loading-bar' ] ) . config ( [ 'cfpLoadingBarProvider' , function ( cfpLoadingBarProvider ) { cfpLoadingBarProvider . includeSpinner = false ; } ] ) Turn the loading bar on or off: Like the spinner configuration above, the loading bar can also be turned off for cases where you only want the spinner: angular . module ( 'myApp' , [ 'angular-loading-bar' ] ) . config ( [ 'cfpLoadingBarProvider' , function ( cfpLoadingBarProvider ) { cfpLoadingBarProvider . includeBar = false ; } ] ) Customize the template: If you'd like to replace the default HTML template you can configure it by providing inline HTML as a string: angular . module ( 'myApp' , [ 'angular-loading-bar' ] ) . config ( [ 'cfpLoadingBarProvider' , function ( cfpLoadingBarProvider ) { cfpLoadingBarProvider . spinnerTemplate = '&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=""fa fa-spinner""&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;' ; } ] ) Position the template: If you'd like to position the loadingBar or spinner, provide a CSS selector to the element you'd like the template injected into. The default is the  &lt;body&gt;  element: angular . module ( 'myApp' , [ 'angular-loading-bar' ] ) . config ( [ 'cfpLoadingBarProvider' , function ( cfpLoadingBarProvider ) { cfpLoadingBarProvider . parentSelector = '#loading-bar-container' ; cfpLoadingBarProvider . spinnerTemplate = '&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=""fa fa-spinner""&gt;Custom Loading Message...&lt;/div&gt;' ; } ] ) &lt; div id ="" loading-bar-container "" &gt; &lt;/ div &gt; Latency Threshold By default, the loading bar will only display after it has been waiting for a response for over 100ms.  This helps keep things feeling snappy, and avoids the annoyingness of showing a loading bar every few seconds on really chatty applications.  This threshold is totally configurable: angular . module ( 'myApp' , [ 'angular-loading-bar' ] ) . config ( [ 'cfpLoadingBarProvider' , function ( cfpLoadingBarProvider ) { cfpLoadingBarProvider . latencyThreshold = 500 ; } ] ) Ignoring particular XHR requests: The loading bar can also be forced to ignore certain requests, for example, when long-polling or periodically sending debugging information back to the server. // ignore a particular $http GET: $http . get ( '/status' , { ignoreLoadingBar :  true } ) ; // ignore a particular $http POST.  Note: POST and GET have different // method signatures: $http . post ( '/save' , data , { ignoreLoadingBar :  true } ) ; // ignore particular $resource requests: . factory ( 'Restaurant' , function ( $resource ) { return $resource ( '/api/restaurant/:id' , { id :  '@id' } , { query :  { method :  'GET' , isArray :  true , ignoreLoadingBar :  true } } ) ; } ) ; How it works: This library is split into two modules, an $http  interceptor , and a  service : Interceptor cfp.loadingBarInterceptor  as a dependency for your module. Service set()  is called, and  complete() s the whole show by removing the loading bar from the DOM. Service API (advanced usage) Under normal circumstances you won't need to use this.  However, if you wish to use the loading bar without the interceptor, you can do that as well.  Simply include the loading bar service as a dependency instead of the main  angular-loading-bar  module: angular . module ( 'myApp' , [ 'cfp.loadingBar' ] ) cfpLoadingBar . start ( ) ; // will insert the loading bar into the DOM, and display its progress at 1%. // It will automatically call `inc()` repeatedly to give the illusion that the page load is progressing. cfpLoadingBar . inc ( ) ; // increments the loading bar by a random amount. // It is important to note that the auto incrementing will begin to slow down as // the progress increases.  This is to prevent the loading bar from appearing // completed (or almost complete) before the XHR request has responded. cfpLoadingBar . set ( 0.3 ) // Set the loading bar to 30% cfpLoadingBar . status ( ) // Returns the loading bar's progress. // -&gt; 0.3 cfpLoadingBar . complete ( ) // Set the loading bar's progress to 100%, and then remove it from the DOM. Events The loading bar broadcasts the following events over $rootScope allowing further customization: cfpLoadingBar:loading  triggered upon each XHR request that is not already cached cfpLoadingBar:loaded  triggered each time an XHR request recieves a response (either successful or error) cfpLoadingBar:started  triggered once upon the first XHR request.  Will trigger again if another request goes out after  cfpLoadingBar:completed  has triggered. cfpLoadingBar:completed  triggered once when the all XHR requests have returned (either successfully or not) Credits: Credit goes to  rstacruz  for his excellent  nProgress .
